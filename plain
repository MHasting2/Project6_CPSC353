 “THE STOLEN CHILD”
WHERE DIPS THE ROCKY HIGHLAND
OF SLEUTH WOOD TO THE LAKE,
THERE LIES A LEAFY ISLAND 
WHERE FLAPPING HERONS WAKE
THE DROWSY RIVER RATS; 
THERE WE KEEP OUR FAIRY VATS,
FULL OF BERRYS
AND OF REDDEST STOLEN CHERRIES. 

COME AWAY O HUMAN CHILD!
TO THE WATERS AND WILD
WITH A FAERY HAND IN HAND
FOR THE WORLD’S MORE FULL OF WEEPING THAN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
(IT GOES ON LIKE THIS, FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED LINES OR SO)
		       –W.B. YEATS  (1865-1939)
